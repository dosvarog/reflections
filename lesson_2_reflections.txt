When I initialize new repository, git creates some files it needs for working
properly.
I need to do it if I want git to track files I want it to track.

Staging area is "waiting area" for files. It increases flexibility regarding
version control and tracking.

You work on one logical change and you stage only that change. After that you
commit that change.

When you need new experimental feature, for example. Branches allow you to
make different version of a project with different features.
