How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Diff shows difference between two files so it is trivial to see what has
    changed. I've been using diff for a long time now.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Very easy, since one can have access to history of changing that file, and
    possibly reverting to older versions, backing up, and so on.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: You commit whenever you like, you have absolute control.
    Con: You forget shit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because that is better thing, program itself keeps track regarding which
    files were changed at the same time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can use them very easily, you just type them into terminal.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can easily revert to previous state so you just break things.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Fucking programming of course.
